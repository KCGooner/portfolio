    <p> Hello, my name is Joe Huelsman and I am twenty eight years old. I am from Garnder, Kansas where I grew up with a small family just my parents, my younger brother, and myself. As a child I was very active in sports, I played baseball, basketball, football and for a very brief moment soccer but quickly learned I did not like running. In high school I had a passion for all things computers and ended up taking some coding classes my sophomore thru senior year of high school. I have always had a interest in how the internet and websites work and have recently decided to go back and I am now currently enrolled in the KU Coding Boot Camp program. I will be sharing some of the work that I will be doing over the course of the next six months. I hope that you will be able to see my skills grow and develop and I aim to become a proficient and hardworking developer.
